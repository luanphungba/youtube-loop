# YouTube Video Looper

A web-based tool that helps language learners and others to loop specific sections of YouTube videos. Perfect for practicing listening comprehension, memorizing dialogues, or studying any video content that requires repetition.

## Motivation

I created this tool while learning a new language because I needed to:
- Loop specific conversations/dialogues from YouTube videos repeatedly
- Save timestamps of useful conversations for future review
- Quickly access these video segments without having to manually configure timestamps each time
- Create shareable links for my Anki flashcards that would automatically play the correct video segment

## Features

- 🎯 Loop specific sections of any YouTube video
- ⏱️ Set precise start and end times (supports both mm:ss and hh:mm:ss formats)
- 🔄 Configure the number of times to loop
- 🔗 Generate shareable URLs that preserve all your loop settings
- 📱 Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile
- 🚀 No installation required - works directly in your browser

## How to Use

1. Paste a YouTube URL into the input field
2. Set the start time of the section you want to loop
3. Set the end time of the section
4. Choose how many times you want it to loop
5. Click "Load Video"
6. Use the "Copy" button to get a shareable URL that includes all your settings

### Perfect for:
- Language learners practicing pronunciation
- Students reviewing educational content
- Musicians learning new songs
- Anyone who needs to review specific parts of a video repeatedly

## Use with Anki

You can enhance your Anki flashcards by:
1. Setting up the video loop you want to study
